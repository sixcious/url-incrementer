# URL Incrementer

URL Incrementer (URLI) lets you "increment" [+] any part of the URL. You can use it on gallery or thumbnail websites, forums, or any website that keeps its URLs organized sequentially by numbers or letters or paginated via links.

Set your own keyboard shortcuts and fine-tune many options, including increment interval, alphanumeric/base and custom regular expression support. It's a lightweight extension that is similar to URL Flipper for Firefox and it was developed with care to not require any special permissions from you.

Please Note: Next [>] Prev [<] functionality is currently experimental and may not work properly on some sites.

Special Thanks:
NickMWPrince, Blue, Blue Chan, Will, Adam C., Coolio Wolfus, and everyone who has providing valuable feedback/comments in the reviews and support.

... and of course YOU for using this extension! :)

What's New in Version 4.0 (April 24, 2018)
- New name and look! "URL Plus" is now "URL Incrementer" (URLI) with a new extension icon and more intuitive UI icons
- New Auto increment/decrement functionality (Thanks to NickMWPrince!)
- Icon Feedback option when incrementing/decrementing
- When you click on the extension icon, automatically brings up the Setup panel if the tab instance hasn't been setup yet
- Changed default keyboard shortcuts from Alt+Ctrl+Shift+? to Alt+Shift+? due to some platforms disabling the former recently (Thanks to Blue!)
- Internal code changes: better tab instance memory management (now using JavaScript Map instead of array) and improved internal keyboard shortcuts to support modifier keys (e.g. "Shift" can be used by itself now)

What's New in Version 3.3 (July 20, 2015)
- Added back internal keyboard and mouse button shortcuts
- Added support for Alphanumeric and Bases (Base 2 Binary thru Base 36 Hexatrigesimal)
- Added support for selection customization including using custom Regular Expressions
- To provide better flexibility, Plus [+], Minus [-], Next [>], and Prev [<] are now each separate shortcut operations and are no longer "shared" together
- Next [>] Prev [<] functionality now only works with quick shortcuts and was removed from UI to avoid confusion with Plus [+] Minus [-] Setup
- Fixed leading zeros issue where it would forget a number originally had a leading zero after Plus [+]'ing it (e.g. 09 -> 10)
- Fixed an issue where it would forget its URL/Pattern when you go back to Setup after navigating away
- Note: The options had to be reset to fix and make all the changes in this update. I'm very sorry for the inconvenience. I apologize deeply to anyone who used this extension from 7/1/2015 thru 7/19/2015 (Version 3 thru 3.2). The extension was in a beta state and should have undergone much more testing before being updated.
