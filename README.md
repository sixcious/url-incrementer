# URL Incrementer

![URL Incrementer](_assets/img/darku/128.png?raw=true "URL Incrementer")

Important:
This extension is experimental and may contain bugs.

URLI can help you increment URLs. For example, if the URL has a "page=1" in it or if there's a Next [>] link on the page, URLI can get you to "page=2" quickly and conveniently.

Notes
Using programs or "macros" to translate keyboard shortcuts into mouse buttons are not officially supported; you must use Logitech's Macro (NOT the "Keystroke" option).

"URLI's Toolkit" is a special tool I made to test URLI, "unlocked" for you! But because this is a developer's tool, it's not a standard feature of this extension, so please don't expect it to work 100% perfectly! Thank you for understanding. 

Download Incrementing is an optional and experimental feature that is designed to be used with Auto. URLI can use its Auto-Incrementing capabilities to offer you a unique and flexible "Auto Incrementer Downloader" (think a simple "Down them all" that runs automatically)! It's still rough around the edges, and very much still in BETA. Thank you for being patient as this feature continues to be improved!

To help protect your privacy, Your Saved URLs are only stored as IRREVERSIBLE cryptographic hashes. Saved URL Wildcards and Regular Expressions are stored as POTENTIALLY DECRYPTABLE hashes. All hashes are only stored locally on your device, and no part of any URL is ever saved in plaintext form.

URLI has been tested by me to work on Firefox for Android, but it isn't "officially" supported at this time.
It's recommended to disable all the Keyboard Shortcuts and change the Mouse Shortcuts to "Left" so you can double or triple tap (click) to increment or decrement. :)
