# URL Incrementer

URLI ("yur-lee") increments URLs. For example, if the URL has a "page=1" in it, URLI can get you to "page=2" quickly and conveniently. You can use it on gallery or thumbnail websites, forums, or any site that keeps its URLs organized sequentially. It has a ton of features, but it is a lightweight extension (under 300KB unzipped!) and its core increment functionality doesn't require any special permissions from you.

To start using URLI right away, click the extension icon and select the number in the URL you want to increment. You can then either toggle on AUTO if you want to let URLI Auto-Increment for you or just hit Accept and increment yourself by pressing the [+] button or using Shortcuts. Tip!: URLI can also increment without needing to click the icon via shortcuts, just make sure "Quick Shortcuts" is checked in the Options.

Features:
- Auto Incrementing (Web Page Slideshow)
- Download** Incrementing [Experimental] (Requires Extra Permissions)
- Increment [+] Decrement [-]
- Next [>] Prev [<]
- Chrome Shortcuts
- Internal Keyboard and Mouse Button Shortcuts (Requires Extra Permissions)
- Many Options (Alphanumeric Incrementing, Selection algorithms, Interval, Leading Zeros, Error Skipping... and so much more)
- Safe, Open Source, NO Ads, NO Bloat, and Requires NO permissions for most functionality

**Download is an optional and "experimental" feature that's intended to be used with Auto. URLI can combine both its Auto-Incrementing capabilities with a Downloading to offer a unique Auto Incrementer Downloader! It's still rough around the edges, so I ask for your patience as I work hard to get it up to snuff. Thank you very much for understanding!

URLI 5.0 and a personal apology ....
If you were using Versions 3 or 4, I want to sincerely apologize for the state this extension has been in. You deserve a better extension and I'm grateful to still have you as a user. Version 5 was developed for you. I tried hard to go back to URLI's roots in 5.0.
While working on 5.0, I re-installed Version 2.1 and tried to make sure 5.0 was as simple and easy to use as that version out of the box, while still adding as much functionality.
I know this is going to sound cliche, but ... without "U" there is no URLI.
THANK YOU (x Infinity) for letting URLI play a small part in your Chrome experience!

What's New in Version 5.0 (May 31, 2018)
- URLI, the extension mascot, is back. The extension name was changed from "URL Plus" back to "URL Incrementer" (URLI's original name!).
- NEW Look: New extension icon and more intuitive, color-coded circle buttons that match URLI's early versions! (Blue for Increment/Decrement, Green for Next/Prev, Red for Clear, Orange for Auto, and Purple for Download)
- NEW Auto Increment function: Supports Multiple Tabs and it also has Pause/Resume functionality! Hooray for no more manual incrementing! (Unless you still want to!)
- NEW Download Increment function [Experimental]: Added to URLI so that with Auto, you can have your own "Auto Incrementer Downloader," combining URLI's sophisticated Auto Incrementing functionality with rudimentary Downloading! =) This feature is COMPLETELY optional (opt-in) and requires your permissions to enable it.
- NEW Error Skipping protection: Before incrementing, we can now check in advance (up to 10 times) to avoid HTTP 404 Page Not Found and all 4XX Client Errors, 5XX Server Errors, and 3XX Redirects!
- MANY options added: Change the extension icon to match your toolbar theme, adjust the button sizes, get icon feedback when incrementing, and add Next Prev buttons to the Popup UI (...only if you want to!)
- MANY convenience enhancements: Now saves changes you make in Popup UI, automatically brings up the Setup panel if the URL hasn't been setup, and better support for selecting the part of the URL (now includes touch support!)
- IMPROVED Increment Decrement selection algorithm to look for common terms like "page=" first so the number pre-selected by URLI is more likely to be "correct"
- IMPROVED Next Prev functionality for MUCH better link accuracy
- IMPROVED Internal Shortcuts: Updated KeyboardEvent: "keyCode" to "code" and MouseEvent: "which" to "button" and also now supports modifier keys as shortcuts (e.g. not that you should, but "Shift" can be used by itself now)
- IMPROVED Permissions: Permissions for features (Internal Shortcuts, Next Prev, Download) are now modularized and separate so you can grant and enable only the features you want to
- IMPROVED Internal code: Better tab instance memory management (now using JavaScript Map instead of array) + numerous minor bugfixes
- NOTE: The options had to be reset due to this major update and the way URLI now modularizes permissions for each feature. I'm very sorry for the inconvenience!

Special Thanks:

... and "U" for using "URLI"! :)
