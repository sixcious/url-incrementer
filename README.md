# URL Incrementer

URLI ("yur-lee") lets you "Increment" [+] a URL or go to the "Next" [>] URL. For example, if the URL has a "page=1" in it, this extension will get you to "page=2" quickly and conveniently. Use it on gallery or thumbnail websites, forums, or any site that keeps its URLs organized sequentially by numbers or letters or paginated via next prev links. It has a ton of features, but is a lightweight extension (under 300KB unzipped!) and its core increment functionality doesn't require any special permissions from you.

To start using URLI right away, just click the extension icon, select the number in the URL you want to increment, and then press the [+] button or shortcuts to start incrementing!
You can also use URLI's sophisticated Auto-Incrementer to create your very own web page slideshow ... or maybe to "pretend" you're working... No one has to know!

Features:
- Auto Incrementing
- Download n' Increment** [Experimental] (Requires Extra Permissions)
- Next [>] Prev [<]
- Chrome Shortcuts
- Internal Keyboard & Mouse Button Shortcuts (Requires Extra Permissions)
- Many Options (Alphanumeric Incrementing, Selection algorithms, Interval, Leading Zeros... and so much more)
- Safe, Open-Source, No Ads, No Bloat, and Requires No permissions for core incrementing/auto-incrementing functionality. How cool is that!

**Download is an optional and "experimental" feature that's been added to provide you with an "Auto Incrementer Downloader." Combining URLI's Auto-Incrementing capabilities with rudimentary Downloading! It's still rough around the edges, so I ask for your patience as I work hard to get it up to snuff. Thank you very much for understanding!

What's New in Version 5.0 (May 31, 2018)
- URLI's biggest update... EVER!
- NEW Name: URLI's full name name was changed from "URL Plus"/Incrementer" to "URL Increnex" to help give it a unique name. Same acronym (URLI), but just a new unique full name. Please do NOT worry! URLI's functionality and focus remains the same as always: Incrementing!
- NEW Look: New extension icon and more intuitive, color-coded buttons! (Blue for Increment/Decrement, Green for Next/Prev, Red for Clear, Orange for Auto, and Purple for Download)
- NEW Auto Increment function: Supports Multiple Tabs and it also has Pause/Resume functionality! Hooray for no more manual incrementing! (Unless you still want to!)
- NEW "Download n' Increment" function [Experimental]: Added to URLI so that with Auto, you can have your own "Auto Incrementer Downloader," combining URLI's sophisticated Auto Incrementing functionality with rudimentary Downloading! =) This feature is completely optional.
- MANY options added: Change the extension icon, adjust the button sizes, get icon feedback when incrementing, and add Next Prev buttons to the Popup UI (...only if you want to!)
- MANY convenience enhancements: Now saves changes you make in Popup UI, automatically brings up the Setup panel if the URL hasn't been setup, and better support for selecting the part of the URL (now includes touch support!)
- IMPROVED Increment Decrement selection algorithm to look for common terms like "page=" first so the number pre-selected by URLI is more likely to be "correct"
- IMPROVED Next Prev functionality for MUCH better link accuracy (way better DOM parsing, but still a work in progress)
- IMPROVED Internal Shortcuts: Updated KeyboardEvent: "keyCode" to "code" and MouseEvent: "which" to "button" and also now supports modifier keys as shortcuts (e.g. "Shift" can be used by itself now)
- IMPROVED Permissions: Permissions for features (Internal Shortcuts, Next Prev, Download) are now modularized and separate so you can grant and enable only the features you want to
- IMPROVED Internal code: Better tab instance memory management (now using JavaScript Map instead of array) + numerous minor bugfixes
- NOTE: The options had to be reset due to this major update and the way URLI now modularizes permissions for each feature. I'm very sorry for the inconvenience!
