### Important Note About Version 6 (September 2024)
In order to update URLI to Manifest V3 (MV3), the permissions level needed to be increased to `<all_urls>`. Please see this [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/sixcious/url-incrementer/issues/17) for more information. Thank you for your understanding.

#### Feature Notes
- Firefox only: Local file:// URLs may not increment due to a bug in Firefox (Bug 1266960)
- Mapping shortcut keys to mouse buttons with 3rd party apps like Logitech Gaming Software is not officially supported and may only work if you use Logitech's "Multikey Macro" option

## Permissions Justification
`Read and change all your data on the websites you visit`- URLI needs to request this permission so that it can offer its advanced internal shortcuts, auto incrementing, and for the content script to load on each page you want to incrememt.

## Privacy Policy
